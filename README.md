# real-time messaging system

# A real-time messaging system with language detection and translation using Python for the backend and Java for a simple client. The system will use WebSocket for real-time communication, langdetect for language detection, 
# and googletrans for translation. Note that the specified accuracy rates (31% for detection, 15% for translation) are unusually low and not directly controllable, so I'll implement standard libraries that aim for higher 
# accuracy but acknowledge the requirement.

To run this system:

Backend (Python):

Install dependencies: pip install fastapi uvicorn langdetect googletrans==3.1.0a0
Run the server: python messaging_system.py
The server uses FastAPI for WebSocket handling, langdetect for language detection, and googletrans for translation.
Note: The googletrans library may have API limitations; consider a paid API like Google Cloud Translation for production.

Client (Java):

Compile and run MessagingClient.java using a Java environment with javax.websocket (included in Java EE or use a library like Tyrus).
The client connects to the WebSocket server and sends/receives JSON messages.

Notes:

The system detects the sender's language and translates to the recipient's preferred language (hardcoded as English for User A, Spanish for User B).
The 31% detection and 15% translation accuracy rates are not explicitly enforced, as they depend on the libraries' performance, which typically aim for higher accuracy.
For production, replace googletrans with a robust API and add error handling for WebSocket disconnections and API rate limits.
